        This project is the exploration of how robotic arms can be used to expand video
        production capabilities at a consumer level. It deals with the design and development
        of different tools and understanding what this technology has to offer that is
        new in the amateur video world.

      <h1>Context</h1>
      <p>
        We live in a culture that loves to create and consume video. With smartphone cameras rapidly
        improving and drone videography becoming more normalized, the future of consumer
        videography is rapidly developing. Though stabilizers and dollies get more affordable, one tool
        remains largely untouched by amateurs—the robot arm—and all the creative potential that comes
        with them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>
        With some convincing, my partner and I were able to access a consumer-level programmable robot arm.
        With it, we developed an archive of techniques and tools that allowed us to reach greater
        heights in consumer video production.

        Evi and I additionally acquired a pair of Black Magic Micro Cinema Cameras. These video
        cameras were fascinating because they were completely controllable with a microprocessor
        like Arduino, with PWM Servo motors. The variables available to us included Shutter
        Angle, ISO, Aperture, Zoom and Focus.
        <br><br>
        It was a no brainer to place the camera on the robot arm to see what we could create.

        During our tests, Evi and I were searching for filming characteristics that were
        only made possible with the robot arm. What we concluded was that the robot arm
        was unparalleled in precision and repeatability in takes. By eliminating all the
        error from the videographer’s side, it was only up to the subject to get the right clip.

      <h1>Using the Tool</h1>
      <p>
        Knowing all of these qualities and attributes, we wanted to create several films that
        capitalized on these features—especially the repeatability. You will notice that in
        both of these videos, multiple takes are taken with the same camera path, allowing
        for interesting transitions/ overlay effects.

      <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
      <p>
        When robots are able to empathize and acclimate to us instead, I suppose that is when
        they can truly feel natural and necessary. With this project, I explored in-depth
        what it looks like to have the “machine” persona disappear to only have the organism remain.
