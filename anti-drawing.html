      <p>This is a robot that allows for an augmented drawing experience by manipulating the
        rotation and position of an ordinary piece of paper. This “machine” exists at that very
        fine line between disruption and collaboration, trying to be a little bit of both at the same time.

      <h1>Context</h1>
      <p>
        This project aims to be a fun way to change the ways we see robots today—instead
        of purely utilitarian and precise, we created a robot that can be whimsical and
        imperfect.

      <p>
        For this project, I was in charge of design, electronics, exhibition, and documentation.
        The other two teammates focused on the paper movement and vision code, and we all worked
        on fabrication together.

        It was really important for me to have a well crafted piece. My role as a designer
        is to create a good user experience, and part of that is having a beautiful object
        that doesn’t distract from the actual interaction. Though a lot more work, this was
        an important part of the project!

      <p>
        For our final exhibition, we sealed everything inside of a clean box. We wanted to have
        paper available for people to take and draw on, so we cut 30 sheets of 18″ x 18″ paper.
        The lighting was set so that all the focus was on the paper.

      <p>
        It was really interesting to observe how different people used the machine differently. Most people
        made very gestural and pattern-based drawings, but other people treated it like a game where
        they were determined to finish their original drawings.

        We found interesting behavior emerging from the usage of the machine—people were
        able to invent new techniques as well as produce strokes that would otherwise be
        impossible. To us this was a win.

        There was a spectrum of feedback, from mild frustration to wild enjoyment. Most of the
        participants did not recognize any sort of logic in the robot motion unless they
        specifically asked about it. This was largely due to the focus mainly being on the drawing itself.

        Ultimately, everyone who tried the machine told us they had a fun time and were
        extremely pleased to have created a drawing that is not necessarily perfect. This
        machine seemed to alleviate the expectations to make drawings with extreme craft,
        and it kind of “evened the playing field” for all participants.

      <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
      <p>
        With a lot of physical computing projects, there is a tendency to create a very hacky-makey
        object and focus mostly on the code. However, I learned a lot about the value of having good
        craft in both the code and the physical object itself. I spent a lot more time on making an
        enclosed object with minimal electronics, and it paid off in creating a more seamless and ‘magical’
        experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of reimagining the ways we do everyday things
        with new platforms, tools, and technologies.
